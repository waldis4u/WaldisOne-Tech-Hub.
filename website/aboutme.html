                    Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn." – Steve Jobs. This one quote is something that makes me want to be educated, and educate others through the use of technology. If it wasn't for the era I grew
                    up in, I wouldn't be as grateful for today's technology as others are today. From the earliest moments of my life that I can remember, I was always amazed by computers. I vividly remember the joy I got from operating my first Pentium
                    One PC for the first time at the age of 12 years old. Ever since that day I have been hooked. From Assembling, Disassemble and Troubleshooting PC's, I have been enjoying the brilliance of today's technology all of my life. Education
                    in Computer Science was something I dreamt of from a young age. To be able to study a course that not only interested me, but I genuinely enjoyed working with it. I am currently studying Computing and IT at DataLink University College
                    and am almost done with my second-year education but mostly do personal studies with Youtube and Google (self-taught). I feel that this course has helped improve both my creativity and design thus complimenting the visionary skills
                    needed when studying my current subjects. Outside of my coding lectures, I enjoy creating my own few lines of application as a hobby including a simple application to calculate the monthly salary of the Ghanaian Navy and to top it,
                    i have written some python code that checks if it user is okay after He/She drops the phone (more like emergency contacts that can get the user help).<br/><br />Computing has made me more aware of how higher education
                    works as I am constantly having to carry out my research in my spare time to help aid me. My problem-solving skills have been influenced the most by this course due to the coding which I find very challenging in some stages, but very
                    rewarding when it is solved.<br /> <br />I love teaching younger ones assembling, disassembling and troubleshooting as well as coding with my small coding club. I find this extremely rewarding as I can pass on what I have learned to
                    help others as well as sharpen my communication skills, I am a very outgoing person and love to become the best in what I do.<br /><br /> Another hobby of mine is gaming and free hand sketching, but one factor which lead me to become
                    so interested in Computer Science is the fact that programming can help save a life with simple lines of code. I have completed an internship program with Kehillah Global Ghana. I feel programming and the edge to learn more will allow
                    me meet people all over the world.<br /><br /> Overall, I feel that I am an extremely hardworking and creative person and wants to challenge myself now and in the future. My coding club is about 50 kids and all kind of support is highly
